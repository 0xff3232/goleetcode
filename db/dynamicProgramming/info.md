# Dynamic Programming

## What is Dynamic Programming?
*An efficent way to explore all possible solutions to a problem systematically*

Dynamic Programming (DP) problems often include these characteristics:
1.    The problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems. 
2.    The prolem has "optimal substructure", meaning solving subproblems from the problem can form solutions to solve the problem.

*an example of dynamic programming is the fibonaci sequence*

2.    Top-down, also known as memoization.
